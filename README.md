# Self-Learning-App ðŸ“²

This project was designed under the Reskill American Program as a team project conducted by me and my teammates. The problem statement for our team established that we had to design and implement an App to support self-learning students to find and connect to voluntary tutors in the tech field. Most of the high-level requirements were pre-defined by the program. I was the UX designer of my team and my duties involved going through the Defining, Ideating, Prototyping stages. Here you can access the low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes that resulted from this project.

In this repo, you can find the description of the problem (Problem Brief) with some high-level requirements. You can also find the link to the Figma Project and my presentation.
